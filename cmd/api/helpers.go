// Retrieve the "id" URL parameter from the current request context, then convert it to
// an integer and return it. If the operation isn't successful, return 0 and an error.
// The readIDParam() method doesnâ€™t use any dependencies from our application struct so it could just be a regular function, rather than a method on application. But in general, I suggest setting up all your application-specific handlers and helpers so that they are methods on application. It helps maintain consistency in your code structure, and also future-proofs your code for when those handlers and helpers change later and they do need access to a dependency.

	// When httprouter is parsing a request, any interpolated URL parameters will be
	// stored in the request context. We can use the ParamsFromContext() function to
	// retrieve a slice containing these parameter names and values.
	params := httprouter.ParamsFromContext(r.Context())

	// We can then use the ByName() method to get the value of the "id" parameter from
	// the slice. In our project all movies will have a unique positive integer ID, but
	// the value returned by ByName() is always a string. So we try to convert it to a
	// base 10 integer (with a bit size of 64). If the parameter couldn't be converted,
	// or is less than 1, we know the ID is invalid so we use the http.NotFound()
	// function to return a 404 Not Found response.

	// At this point, we know that we won't encounter any more errors before writing the
    // response, so it's safe to add any headers that we want to include. We loop
    // through the header map and add each header to the http.ResponseWriter's header map.
    // Note that it's OK if the provided header map is nil. Go doesn't throw an error
    // if you try to range over (or generally, read from) a nil map.
